#### Fixed Bugs
1. Bug found where calling any show**Screen function would hide the contact button in the header.
- Fixed by changing the class name from "contact" to "contact-button" as the contact screen had the class "contact".
---
2. Bug found where calling createGame would give an error when selecting "medium" difficulty but not on any other.
- Fixed by removing an accidental space found in "medium" button id.
